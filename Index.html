            <h2>First Programs</h2>
            <h5>The Manchester Baby, the world's first stored program computer, ran its first program</h5>
            <p>Three programs were written for the computer. The first, consisting of 17 instructions, was writ-ten by Kilburn, and so far, as can be ascertained first ran on 21 June 1948. It was designed to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The divisions were implemented by repeated subtractions of the divisor. The Baby took 3.5 million operations and 52 minutes to produce the answer (131,072). The program used eight words of working storage in addition to its 17 words of instructions, giving a program size of 25 words. </p>
            <p>Geoff Tootill wrote an amended version of the program the following month, and in mid-July Alan Turing — who had been appointed as a reader in the mathematics department at Manches-ter University in September 1948 — submitted the third program, to carry out long division. Tu-ring had by then been appointed to the nominal post of Deputy Director of the Computing Ma-chine Laboratory at the university, although the laboratory did not become a physical reality until 1951.  </p>

            <p>In 1998, a working replica of the Baby, now on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, was built to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the running of its first program. Demonstrations of the machine in operation are held regularly at the museum. </p>
            <p>In 2008, an original panoramic photograph of the entire machine was discovered at the Universi-ty of Manchester. The photograph, taken on 15 December 1948 by a research student, Alec Robinson, had been reproduced in The Illustrated London News in June 1949. </p>
